# Automated Testing in R: A Practical Guide

- **Part I: Foundations of Testing**
  - **Why Test Your R Code?**
    - Understand why testing matters in R workflows
    - Prevent regressions, catch silent errors early
    - Improve collaboration and maintainability

  - **Types of Automated Tests**
    - **Unit Tests**
      - Test single functions in isolation
      - Fast, deterministic, and numerous
    - **Integration Tests**
      - Type of Unit Tests.
      - Test interactions between components (e.g., API + DB)
      - Validate data flow and interface boundaries
    - **Acceptance Tests**
      - Simulate user-level scenarios and workflows
      - Often derived from business or research requirements

  - **Testing Workflows**
    - **Test-First**
      - Write tests before code to define expected behavior
      - Reduces overengineering and guides design
      - Write only the code you need.
      - **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
        - Describe system behavior in plain language
        - Focus on business outcomes and user intent
      - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
        - Use “Red → Green → Refactor” cycle
        - Start with a failing test, then implement and refine
      - Inside-out vs outside-in.
    - **Test-Last**
      - Write tests after implementation
      - Still valuable, especially for legacy code and prototyping

- **Part II: Testing Strategies by Problem Type**
  - **Testing R Packages**
    - Optimizing tests organization and structure

  - **Testing Data Pipelines and Transformations**
    - Test each step in the pipeline: input → transform → output
    - Usage of snapshot tests for data frames
    - Property testing with `pointblank`.
    - Handle edge cases (missing, malformed, out-of-range data)

  - **Testing Code with External Dependencies**
    - Mock APIs, databases, or file systems
    - Use test fixtures to simulate external conditions
    - Separate testable logic from dependency code

  - **Testing PlumberAPI**
    - Run api in the background
    - Sync and async requests.

  - **Testing Shiny Applications**
    - Test logic separately from UI.
    - Testing functions that generate HTML.
    - Effective usage of `shinytest2`.

- **Part III: Testing in Practice**
  - **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for R Packages**
    - Write scenarios that describe the feature in plain English
    - Implement tests that fulfill those scenarios
    - Align features with stakeholder expectations

  - **Test-Driven Development (TDD) for R Packages**
    - Write minimal tests before implementing new functions
    - Design cleaner APIs with test feedback
    - Develop one function at a time in test/code/refactor cycles

  - **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for Shiny Applications**
    - Define features from the user's point of view
    - Capture full user journeys and workflows in tests
    - Use BDD to design for usability and accessibility

  - **Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Shiny Applications**
    - Start from testing business logic and reactive expressions
    - Delay UI coding until logic is covered
    - Use mock input/output and reactive values

  - **Structuring Your Test Suite**
    - Organize tests by module, type, or feature
    - Balance between fine-grained and high-level tests
    - Maintain readability and low duplication

  - **Debugging and Fixing Tests**
    - Use failure messages to diagnose root causes
    - Practice defensive testing (informative errors, test clarity)
    - Avoid test flakiness through proper setup/teardown

  - **Test Metrics**
    - Use `covr` to measure which lines are tested
    - Use `muttest` to measure quality of assertions

  - **Continuous Integration and Automation**
    - Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing
    - Automate tests on every commit or pull request
    - Build confidence through fast feedback loops
    - Custom test reports.

- **Part IV: Advanced Topics and Case Studies**
  - **Refactoring with Confidence**
    - Use tests as safety net for large code changes
    - Apply TDD to refactor in small, safe steps
    - Example: turning a script into a package

  - **Writing Testable R Code**
    - Structure code for testability (pure functions, low coupling)
    - Avoid hidden state and global variables
    - Favor dependency injection over hardcoding

  - **Testing in Collaborative Teams**
    - Define testing conventions and policies
    - Use code reviews to reinforce test coverage
